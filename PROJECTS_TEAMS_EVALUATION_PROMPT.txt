EVALUATION REQUEST: Gradio Projects & Teams Implementation

You are being asked to review and evaluate a new implementation: **Projects & Teams functionality for Gradio UI**.

## Context

We've implemented a comprehensive Projects & Teams system for the Gradio UI to provide fast project configuration and multi-team sequential execution with human approval checkpoints between teams.

**Goal**: Make Gradio "faster to configure" than React while maintaining all key features.

**Key Features**:
1. Project management (create, list, delete projects)
2. Team builder (add teams with custom agents to projects)
3. Sequential team execution with checkpoints
4. Template library (6 pre-built project templates)
5. Context passing between teams
6. JSON file persistence

## Files to Review

Please review the following files:

1. **projects_store.py** - Storage system and data models
   - ProjectsStore class for CRUD operations
   - PROJECT_TEMPLATES dictionary (6 templates)
   - JSON persistence layer

2. **GRADIO_PROJECTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Implementation plan
   - Architecture overview
   - UI component designs
   - Execution flow logic
   - Event handlers
   - Helper functions

## Evaluation Criteria

Please evaluate across the following dimensions:

### 1. Architecture & Code Quality (Senior, Architect, TechnicalLead)

**Questions to Answer**:
- Is the ProjectsStore class well-designed with clear separation of concerns?
- Are the data models (project schema, team schema) appropriate?
- Is JSON file storage a good choice for this use case? Should we use SQLite instead?
- Are there any architectural patterns that could improve the design?
- Is the code maintainable and extensible?
- Any code smells or anti-patterns?
- Error handling: Are exceptions handled gracefully?
- Performance: Any bottlenecks with file I/O?

**Specific Issues to Check**:
- Thread safety: Multiple Gradio sessions accessing the same JSON file
- Data integrity: What happens if JSON file is corrupted?
- Scalability: How many projects can the system handle?
- Concurrency: Can multiple users run projects simultaneously?

### 2. User Experience & UI/UX (ProductDesigner, UXResearcher, Designs)

**Questions to Answer**:
- Is the tab-based layout (Projects & Teams vs Quick Run) intuitive?
- Is the project creation flow smooth and easy to understand?
- Does the team builder make sense? Is adding teams straightforward?
- Are checkpoint approvals clear? Do users understand what they're approving?
- Is the template library helpful? Are the 6 templates well-chosen?
- Visual design: Are the HTML-rendered team cards readable and attractive?
- Information architecture: Is everything in the right place?
- Feedback: Does the UI provide sufficient feedback for user actions?

**Specific Concerns**:
- Is "Projects & Teams" tab name clear enough? Alternative names?
- Should we show project details inline or in a modal?
- Are teams displayed clearly with their status (pending/running/completed/failed)?
- Is the checkpoint modal design effective for reviewing team output?

### 3. Functionality & Robustness (Senior, QA, Verifier)

**Questions to Answer**:
- Does the execution flow handle all edge cases?
- What happens if a team execution fails mid-project?
- Can users edit/delete teams after adding them?
- Is context passing between teams working correctly?
- Are team outputs saved properly?
- Can users resume a failed project?
- Data validation: Are user inputs validated (project names, team names, etc.)?

**Test Scenarios to Consider**:
1. Create project → Add 3 teams → Run → Approve each checkpoint
2. Create project from template → Run immediately
3. Add team with no agents selected (should error)
4. Delete team from project (is it removed correctly?)
5. Run project with 1 team (should work without checkpoints)
6. Interrupt execution mid-run (can user recover?)
7. Edit team output at checkpoint before continuing
8. Reject at checkpoint (does execution stop cleanly?)

**Edge Cases**:
- Empty project name
- Duplicate project names
- Team with 50 agents (performance)
- Project with 10 teams (UI scalability)
- Very long team output (rendering issues?)
- Concurrent executions (multiple projects running)

### 4. Comparison with React Implementation (ProductOwner, BusinessAnalyst)

**Questions to Answer**:
- Is Gradio implementation truly "faster to configure" than React?
- What features does React have that Gradio is missing?
- What features does Gradio have that React doesn't?
- Which UI is more intuitive for power users?
- Which UI is better for beginners?
- Should we keep both or sunset one?

**Feature Parity Check**:
| Feature | React | Gradio | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Create projects | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Add teams | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Checkpoint approvals | ✓ | ✓ | |
| Template library | ✓ | ✓ | Same 6 templates? |
| Visual workflow builder | ✓ | ✗ | Gradio is text-based |
| Export workflows | ✓ | ? | Should Gradio export YAML? |
| Project search/filter | ✓ | ? | Needed for many projects? |
| Team reordering | ✓ | ? | Drag-and-drop in React |
| Execution history | ✓ | ? | View past executions |

### 5. Implementation Completeness (PM, TechnicalLead)

**Questions to Answer**:
- Is the implementation plan complete and actionable?
- Are all necessary functions defined?
- Are event handlers connected correctly?
- Any missing pieces or gaps in the implementation?
- Is the testing strategy sufficient?
- Documentation: Is the plan clear enough for implementation?

**Missing Features to Consider**:
- Edit existing project (name, description)
- Edit existing team (agents, name)
- Duplicate project (copy with teams)
- Export project to YAML (interop with React)
- Import project from YAML
- Execution history (save past runs)
- Cost tracking per execution
- Search/filter projects
- Archive old projects

### 6. Security & Data Integrity (SecurityEngineer, Verifier)

**Questions to Answer**:
- Is JSON file storage secure? Who can access gradio_projects.json?
- Input validation: Are project/team names sanitized?
- XSS risks: Is HTML rendered safely (gr.HTML components)?
- File permissions: Is JSON file protected?
- Data leakage: Can one user see another's projects?
- Backup strategy: What if JSON file is deleted?

### 7. Performance & Scalability (PerformanceEngineer, SRE)

**Questions to Answer**:
- File I/O: Is reading/writing JSON on every operation acceptable?
- Caching: Should we cache projects in memory?
- Concurrent access: What if 2 users modify the same project?
- Large projects: How does UI perform with 100 projects? 50 teams?
- Execution parallelization: Can we run multiple teams in parallel if they're independent?

### 8. Developer Experience (DeveloperAdvocate, TechnicalWriter)

**Questions to Answer**:
- Is the code easy to understand and modify?
- Are function names clear and descriptive?
- Is the implementation plan detailed enough?
- Are there enough comments and docstrings?
- Would a new developer understand this code quickly?
- Testing: How would someone test this implementation?
