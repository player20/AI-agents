project_description: |
  We're designing a new architecture for our Multi-Agent Development Team platform that allows users to:

  1. **Create Projects** (e.g., "Build E-commerce App", "Marketing Campaign")
  2. **Organize Agent Teams within Projects** (e.g., "Backend Squad", "Frontend Squad", "QA Squad")
  3. **Execute teams sequentially** with outputs flowing between teams
  4. **Visualize as an org chart** showing project → teams → agents hierarchy

  ## Architecture Documents to Review

  Please read and analyze these three documents:

  1. **PROJECT_AGENT_TEAMS_ARCHITECTURE.md**
  2. **AGENT_ORG_CHART_DESIGN.md**
  3. **MULTI_PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md** (for context)

  ## Your Tasks

  Each agent should provide:

  **PM**: Project planning and execution flow analysis
  - Is the execution model practical?
  - How should dependencies between teams work?
  - What about error handling if a team fails?

  **Senior Engineer**: Technical architecture review
  - Database schema assessment
  - API design evaluation
  - Scalability concerns

  **Product Owner**: User experience and value proposition
  - Will users understand the org chart concept?
  - Is this solving a real pain point?
  - What's the learning curve?

  **Ideas Agent**: Creative improvements and alternatives
  - What other ways could we visualize this?
  - How can we make team coordination smarter?
  - Any novel features to add?

  **QA Engineer**: Edge cases and potential issues
  - What could go wrong?
  - How do we test team dependencies?
  - What validation is needed?

  **Verifier**: Critical analysis and fact-checking
  - Are there any logical inconsistencies in the design?
  - Do the documents contradict each other?
  - What assumptions need validation?

  PM: |
    Review the execution flow and project management aspects.

    Focus on:
    - Sequential vs parallel team execution
    - How outputs pass between teams
    - Project status tracking
    - Team dependencies and ordering

    Provide specific recommendations for the execution engine.

  Senior: |
    Deep dive into the technical architecture.

    Analyze:
    - Database schema (Prisma models)
    - API endpoint design
    - Real-time updates architecture
    - Scalability for 100+ projects, 1000+ teams

    Flag any technical red flags or bottlenecks.

  Product: |
    Evaluate from a product/UX perspective.

    Consider:
    - Is the org chart metaphor clear to users?
    - What's the ideal onboarding flow?
    - How do users discover and use this feature?
    - What metrics should we track?

    Suggest UX improvements.

  Ideas: |
    Think creatively about enhancements.

    Brainstorm:
    - Alternative visualization methods beyond org charts
    - Smart features (AI-suggested team compositions, auto-dependencies)
    - Collaboration features (comments, @mentions, team chat)
    - Integration possibilities (GitHub, Jira, Notion)

    Propose 3-5 innovative ideas.

  QA: |
    Identify edge cases and quality concerns.

    Test scenarios:
    - What if a team has 0 agents? 20 agents?
    - What if teams have circular dependencies?
    - How do we handle partial failures?
    - What if user deletes a team mid-execution?

    List all test cases needed.

  Verifier: |
    Critically analyze for consistency and correctness.

    Verify:
    - Do the three architecture docs align?
    - Are there gaps in the implementation plan?
    - Are cost/time estimates realistic?
    - Are there security/privacy concerns?

    Challenge assumptions and point out risks.
